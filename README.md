# H2OSpooky


## Description

**Spooky** is a complete CMS with installer. Its strength is that its features is based on modules. In fact, it supports the complete management of modules (add/disable/delete, ...).

## Spooky... Why that name??

I didn't know what name to give for it. Suddenly, watching a movie, I had the idea of the name, although it can seem a little weird...


## Development Stage

Still in development, but contributions to this project are truly welcome! Simply *Clone It*, *Improve* and then *Push It*.


## H2O..., What's that?

H2O (H2O Engine) is a framework that I coded but is not actually available to everyone. There are some time ago, I had already released its template engine [H2OTpl](https://github.com/pH-7/H2OTpl).

**H2OSpooky** is is somehow based on that framework. This framework is lighter and easier to understand than my other "big" framework called [pH7Framework](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/tree/master/_protected/framework).
